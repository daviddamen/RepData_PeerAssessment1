# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1

The data for this assignment consists of activity measurements:

* _steps_: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing values are coded as NA).
* _date_: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD format.
* _interval_: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which measurement was taken.

It is contained in the activity.zip file in this repo.

## Loading and preprocessing the data

First, we unzip the activity data and read it into a data frame.

```{r, echo = TRUE} 
unzip("activity.zip")
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
